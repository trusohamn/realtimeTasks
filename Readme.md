user stories:

- user can have multiple lists and share the chosen ones by providing username of other users

- collaboration in real time with all the collaborators

- user can create lists and tasks

- todos will be persisted so that important information is
  not lost when server restarts - after simple swap to managed db it would be persisted

- no auth implemented in this project, authorization based on user-id header, which could be easily swapped for jwt
